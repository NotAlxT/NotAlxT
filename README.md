                                                         Hi There, I'm Alex
                       As someone who loves tech and learning new skills. I started as a self-taught developer,
                      I learned front-end and expanded my knowledge of what is needed to be a well-developed engineer.
                       Taking a step forward, I wanted to expand my understanding of back-end work, so I graduated
                           from a full-stack boot camp. My goal is simple, To make coding my purpose in life. 
                                   It is creating projects that will make at least one person's life easier.
