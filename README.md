       As someone who loves tech and learning new skills. I started off as a self-taught developer, I learned front-end and expnaded my knowdlege of what is needed to be a well developed engineer. Taking a step foward I wanted to expand my knowledge of back-end work as well so I graduated from a full stack bootcamp. My goal is simple, To make coding my purpose in life. Creating projects that will make atleast one person's life easier.
